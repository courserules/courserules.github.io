					<ul>
						<li>Review weather</li>
						<li>Review NOTAMs</li>
						<li>Review Bash</li>
						<li>!!!! With weather being as hot as it is, there is a good chance that the Maximum Power at 60 kts is less than 100%.  You need to check this using your quadfold during the Before Takeoff checklist using the IAOT and PRESSURE ALTITUDE.  To determine pressure altitude, set the BFI's altimeter setting to 29.92 (std day) and read your current altitude. Be sure to change it back after to the proper altimeter setting as reported by ATIS. </li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Airsickness History
					<ul>
						<li>Both pilots shall announce if they become passively or actively airsick. They may pass the controls as the situation dictates. The flying pilot will keep the aircraft in a stable position minimizing turns as the situation allows.  If the airsick pilot feels he cannot continue, the mission will be aborted for airsickness.

				<li>Discuss Items</li>
				<li>Special syllabus requirements</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>Mission Execution/Conduct</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduced items</li>
				
			</ul>
			<h5>Communications and Crew Coordination</h5>
			<ul>	
				<li>Frequencies
					<ul>
						<li>We will use preset UHF, VHF and Nav frequencies, and manual frequencies as required.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li>Radio procedures and discipline
					<ul>
						<li>The flying pilot will make all radio calls to be backed up by the non-flying pilot.  Either pilot can make a safety of flight call.  Keep all calls concise and professional.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			
				<li>Change of control of aircraft
					<ul>
						<li>We will use a positive three-way exchange of controls with emphasis on the word "CONTROLS." In the event of an ICS failure, we will use the push-to-pass, shake-to-take method of control transfer with the non-flying pilot showing his/her hands for verification. If in doubt of who is flying the aircraft, query the other pilot.  Transfer of aircraft controls includes the FMS/UFCP and radios.  The non-flying pilot may assist of assume control of the FMS/UFCP and radios as directed.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Navigational Aids/FMS
					<ul>
						<li>Contact/VNAV Stage: We will primarily VFR today using ground reference checkpoints for navigation; however, we will keep the appropriate working area or navigation route in the FMS for back-up.</li>
						<li>INAV Stage: We will use the VOR and FMS as appropriate for Navigation.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Identification
					<ul>
						<li>Our call-sign will be RANGER XXX and we will squawk 55XX/56XX or as assigned by ATC.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Clearing Procedures
					<ul>
						<li>Both pilots shall maintain a vigilant lookout for other traffic using te TCAS to aid as appropriate.  Call out all trafic using the clock system HIGH/LEVEL/LOW, factor/no-factor.  Any pilot recognizing an immediate traffic conflict will immediately manuever the aircraft into a safe position then discuss traffic avoidance after it is no longer a factor.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>Navigation/Flight Planning and Mission Execution/Conduct</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Flight Plan Filed/<span title="Prior Permission Required">PPR</span>
					<ul>
						<li>[Ensure flight plan filed if required.]</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				</li>
				<li>Ground Ops
					<ul>
						<li>In accordance with NATOPS.</li>
						<li>[Brief cockpit assignment (front/rear))</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				</li>
				<li>Takeoff
					<ul>
						<li>In accordance with NATOPS.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Climbout
					<ul>
						<li>Climbout will be in accordance with VFR course rules.</li>
						<li>INAV Stage: We will expect the _______ Departure (as appropriate for the runway in use and filed flight plan) but will remain flexible for changes from ATC.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>G Awareness procedures
					<ul>
						<li>We will conduct a G-Ex prior to conducting any maneuvers requiring greater than 3 Gs, and preface all maneuvers with "Gs coming on, NOW, NOW, NOW." Either pilot experiencing gray-out conditions should immediately call "Knock-it-Off" over the ICS, and a contact unusual attitude recovery should be used to level and unload the aircraft. In the event either pilot experiences a GLOC, the training portion of the flight will be terminated, and the IP will recover the aircraft to Navy Corpus.</li>

						<li>[Brief fuel requirements for planned flight profiles.]</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><span title="Outlying Field">OLF</span> Operations and Entry
					<ul>
						<li>[Brief planned OLF (NGT/NWL/RKP) and entry method (course
rules/PPEL/Simulated Power Loss)]</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Course rules/Home Field Entry/Other Airfield Considerations
					<ul>
						<li>[Brief planned recovery method]</li>
						<li>We will plan to recover via (VFR Course Rules/VFR Arrival/Instrument Approach) to (airfield).</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Penetration/Approach/Missed Approach
					<ul>
						<li>Contact/VNAV Stage: If an instrument approach is required, the IP (or IUT at the IP's discretion) will fly the approach to be backed up by the SNA/IUT on all headings, altitudes, airspeeds, angle of bank, and rates of descent. The SNA/IUT will call the runway environment in sight with clock position, and repeat the current landing clearance (Land/T&G/Option/Low Approach as appropriate).</li>
						<li>INAV Stage: We will plan to recover via the (procedure/runway/airport) approach.  The non-flying pilot will back up the flying pilot on all headings, altitudes, airspeeds, angle of bank, and rates of descent, and report the runway environment in sight using the clock position. If we do not have the runway environment in sight by the DH/MAP, we will execute the assigned missed approach or climbout.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>Emergencies</h5>
			<ul>	
				<li>Abort
					<ul>
						<li>Either pilot recognizing the need to abort will call "ABORT, ABORT, ABORT" over the ICS. The flying pilot will execute the ABORT PROCEDURE IAW NATOPS. If we anticipate departing the prepared surface, we will execute the EMERGENCY ENGINE SHUTDOWN ON THE GROUND PROCEDURE. The Aircraft commander will call "CFS, CFS, CFS" to command execution of the Canopy Fracturing system, or "EJECT, EJECT, EJECT" to command ejection as required.</li>
						<li>[Brief decision matrix/go-nogo for CFS and ejection (i.e.
airspeed, obstacles, etc.)]</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Divert fields</li>
				<li>Minimum and Emergency Fuel
					<ul>
						<li>We will declare MIN FUEL if we anticipate landing below 200 lbs and EMERGENCY FUEL if we anticipate landing below 120 lbs.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Loss of Power
					<ul>
						<li>If we have a loss of power shortly after take-off, we will execute the ENGINE FAILURE IMMEDIATELY AFTER TAKEOFF procedure being mindful of aircraft configuration, energy state and runway length remaining. If insufficient runway length remains to land straight ahead, we will eject. If we have a loss of power elsewhere, we will execute the ENGINE FAILURE DURING FLIGHT PROCEDURE. If we are unable to intercept ELP for suitable landing site, we will eject.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Radio Failure/ICS Failure
					<ul>
						<li>In the event of a radio or res failure, we will troubleshoot in an attempt to re-establish comms or ICS (i.e. Check comm leads all the way to the 02 Mask, check the comm panel and UFCD for appropriate frequencies and switches) If we have a radio failure, we will attempt communication on another radio, using the Standby VHF if necessary. If we have a total loss of communications in the local area, we will comply with the local letter of agreement for IFR/VFR aircraft. If we are outside of the local area, we will comply with the FIH. If we have an ICS failure, we can remove our masks
momentarily and shout, or use the frequency 123.45/246.8 to communicate over the radio as necessary. If ICS cannot be restored, the instructional portion of the flight will be
terminated and we will land as soon as practical.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Inadvertent IMC
					<ul>
						<li>If we inadvertently enter IMC we will fly straight and level for 30 seconds. If operating in an unfamiliar area or there are known ground hazards present we will immediately climb above the maximum elevation figure. If we do not regain VMC within 30 seconds, we will do a standard rate 30 degree angle of bank turn for 180 degrees of heading change in an attempt to regain VMC.  If we are still unable to regain VMC, we will inform ATC and coordinate an IFR clearance for an approach back to homefield.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Loss of Sight/lost Wingman
					<ul>
						<li>We will be single ship today; however, if we are given traffic to follow and we lose sight of it, we will ask ATC for an update.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Downed Pilot and Aircraft
					<ul>
						<li>If we are first on scene to an aircraft mishap, we will assume on-scene commander duties. The flying pilot will establish the aircraft at a safe altitude and distance to maintain visual contact, and the non-flying pilot will initiate the ON-SCENE COMMANDER CHECKLIST. We will set a BINGO fuel to the nearest suitable field, and remain on scene until we: 
							<ol>
								<li>reach our BINGO Fuel
								<li>have a malfunction of our own
								<li>relieved by a more capable platform
								<li>the rescue is complete.
							</ol>
								If we are not first on scene, we may offer assistance but will remain clear unless called upon.</li>
